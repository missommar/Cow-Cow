              <p class="text-content"> Amanda Bergman has touched people around the world with one of the warmest and most distinctive voices for over a decade. What began under the mysterious pseudonyms <em>Hajen</em> and <em>Idiot Wind</em> later culminated as the frontwoman of the supergroup and success story <em>Amason</em> and her own first solo album <em>Docks</em>. Since her debut in 2016, Amanda has managed to buy a farm in Dalarna, release three albums with Amason, win awards, tour, start the concert business "Rockbonden" and record an SVT documentary about life and the farm. <br>
                In the summer of 2024, Amanda Bergman released her second solo album <em>Your Hand Forever Checking On My Fever</em>, an album dominated by both atmospheric and loving twilight serenades, sprung from the hypersensitive breaking point between loss and gratitude that can occur during cataclysmic events. In this case, her father's passing in 2022, or really its entire pre- and post-event. <br>

              <p class="text-content"> <em>Biodiversity</em> in the form of animal and plant species, rich microlife, closed nutrient cycles and pasture-based animal husbandry is the basis of how we strive to manage our farm and land.<br>
                We have approx. 60 hectares of land, the greater part of which is arable land with meadow-like dykes, pasture dykes and cultural cereals in perennial bottom crops. We grow vegetables for self-sufficiency and sometimes sell the surplus to neighbors or people passing by.<br>
                Here on the farm there are mountain cows, Helsinge sheep and just over 100 chickens. Over the past year, we have invested in predator fences on our pasture land in order to secure a long-term perspective in our ambition to improve the land's soil structure through rotational grazing. For this project we have had the pleasure of receiving support from the <em>European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development</em>.<br>
