        <!--<p> Amanda Bergman has touched people around the world with one of the country's warmest and most distinctive voices for over a decade. What began under the mysterious pseudonyms Hajen and Idiot Wind later culminated as the frontwoman of the supergroup and success story Amason and her own first solo album 'Docks'. </p>
        <p>Since her debut in 2016, Amanda has managed to buy a farm in Dalarna, release three albums with Amason, win awards, tour, start the concert business "Rockbonden" and record an SVT documentary about life and the farm. The last eight years have also been marked by new and old life, mental illness and the road back, and eternal pondering over life's big questions. </p>-->
